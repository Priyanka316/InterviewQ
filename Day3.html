    2. Explain inline, internal and external stylesheet. 
    Ans:    Inline CSS: * Requires the style attribute placed inside an HTML element.
                        * Inline CSS is known as "embedded stylesheet", it override 
                        any other CSS targetting the same element.
                        * Inline CSS is effective for targeting a single element with 
                        unique style properties — but it should be avoided when it's 
                        possible to use internal or external CSS.

            Internal CSS: * Requires the style element placed inside the head section of an HTML file.
                          * Internal CSS looks different from inline CSS. 
                          * A CSS property and value is still set, but instead of being placed inside 
                            a style attribute, it is placed inside brackets and defined by a CSS selector.
                          * This rule set is then wrapped in <style></style> tags and found in the head 
                            section of the HTML file.

            External CSS: * Requires the <link> element placed inside the head section of an HTML file.
                          * External CSS is formatted like internal CSS, but it isn’t wrapped in style 
                            tags or placed in the head section of your HTML file. 
                          * Instead, it’s placed in an external file with the extension “.css.” 
                            In the head section, you’ll just have to add a link to this external 
                            stylesheet that looks something like:

    3. Justify content allows you to do what? 
    Ans:    The CSS justify-content property defines how the browser distributes space between 
            and around content items along the main-axis of a flex container, and the inline axis of a grid container.

    4. Difference between absolute and relative position. 
    Ans:    Relative - The element is positioned relative to its normal position. 
                       Relative places an element relative to its current position without changing the layout around it,
            Absolute - The element is positioned absolutely to its first positioned parent.
                       Absolute places an element relative to its parent's position and changing the layout around it.

    5. what is grid-template-columns used for? 
    Ans:    The grid-template-columns property specifies the number (and the widths) of columns in a grid layout. 
            The values are a space separated list, where each value specifies the size of the respective column.

    6. what is z index in css 
    Ans:    Z Index ( z-index ) is a CSS property that defines the order of overlapping HTML elements. 
            Elements with a higher index will be placed on top of elements with a lower index. 
            Z index only works on positioned elements ( position:absolute , position:relative , or position:fixed ).

    7. what is difference between padding and margin. 
    Ans:    Margin: It is the space around an element’s border.
                    The margin property controls the space outside an element.
            Padding: It is the space between an element’s border and the element’s content. 
                     The padding property controls the space inside an element.

    8. What is box sizing 
    Ans:    The CSS box-sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height.

    9. what is animation delay? 
    Ans:    The animation-delay CSS property specifies the amount of time to wait from applying the animation to an element
            before beginning to perform the animation. 
            The animation can start later, immediately from its beginning, or immediately and partway through the animation.

    10. which property you will use to merge cells vertically in grid? 
    Ans:    grid-column Property.

    11. which property you will use to merge cells horizontally in grid? 
    Ans:    grid-row Property.

    12. Explain css box model. 
    Ans:    Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
            Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
            Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
            Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent
    
    13. what is the difference between display none and visibility hidden. 
    Ans:    Visibility:hidden- It is not visible but gets up it’s original space.
            Display:none- It will not appear on the page. It is hidden and takes no space. -->
